# Hand-Sign-Recognition
 This project focuses on developing a shorthand sign language recognition system that uses computer vision and machine learning to detect hand gestures. It processes images or video inputs to identify signs and converts them into text or speech, improving accessibility for individuals with hearing impairments.
